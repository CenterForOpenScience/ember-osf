# Ember OSF

This repo contains code for interacting with the OSF APIv2 inside of an Ember app.

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Configuration

#### Using the Staging or Production API (preferred)

To do this, you will need to [create a developer application](https://staging.osf.io/settings/applications/) on the relevant version of the OSF.

#### Running the OSF Locally (optional)

For local development, you will need to be running the [OSF APIv2](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io#running-the-api-server).
To connect to the APIv2 while using [fakecas](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io#running-the-osf), you will need to generate a
personal access token on your local OSF instance ([here](http://localhost:5000/settings/tokens/-- go ahead and grant access to all scopes)).

#### Create a .env

Next, depending on the environment you want to target, you will need to create the .env file. For:
- local: .env-local
- staging: .env-stage
- staging2: .env-stage2
- production: .env-prod

To do this:
```bash
cp .env-dist .env-<env>
```

Edit the new .env and replace:
- `<your_client_id>` with the client id of your developer application
- `<your_personal_access_token>` with the newly generated token (if applicable)

**Note**: For development, we reccomend point your local app to our staging servers: `ember s --environment staging`

## Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

**Note:** This runs the dummy app contained in /tests/dummy

## Running Tests

* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)
* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

## Building

* `ember build`
