# Style/Conventions

### Checking your code

Code style checking is part of the Travis build, and PRs that do not meet the code style guidelines will not be merged. You can run these checks locally with:
`npm run check-style`

### Naming conventions

Please review and adhere to the naming conventions defined [here](http://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#naming-conventions)

### Accessibility

The [ember-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-a11y) addon is a dependency of this addon, and helps facilitate compliance with the guidelines laid out by the [A11y Project](http://a11yproject.com/). This requires one simple change: wherever you would normally use the `{{outlet}}` helper, instead use `{{focusing-outlet}}`. See the project page for more details.

### Internationalization

_(In Progress)_ We plan to use the [ember-i18n](https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n) addon for internationalization support in all components. The main change required here is that all blocks of text should be wrapped with the `t` helper supplied by this library. Read more here: [https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n/wiki/Doc:-Translating-Text](https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n/wiki/Doc:-Translating-Text)

### Components

We will use "pod" style structure for all of the components in this addon. This means when generating component scaffolds with ember-cli you must pass the --pod flag: `ember g component my-component --pod`. Basically components should be structured like:

- addon/components/<name>/
  - component.js
  - template.hbs
  - style.scss (optional)

#### Styling components

Leveraging the [ember-component-css](https://github.com/ebryn/ember-component-css) addon will allow us to bundle [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files inside components' pod structure, and will automatically namespace those styles to avoid all possible CSS collisions. This approach will allow for easy overrides and paramterization via top-level Sass variables.

# Testing


## Unit tests

We aim to have near-full test coverage of the code in this addon. That said we want to avoid testing the Ember core or third-party libraries, so some general guidelines for unit tets (minumum requirements):

**Models**
_Do test_:
- helper methods
- custom transforms

**Components/Mixins**
_Do test_:
- methods
- computed values

## Integration tests

Integration tests allow us to see how components behave while actually running in a browser enviornment. [TODO](https://openscience.atlassian.net/browse/EOSF-28)

#### Accessibility checks

We will use the [ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/trentmwillis/ember-a11y-testing) addon to run a11y checks on all components.
